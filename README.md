A short and sweet Python project to scrape player and team data for football and basketball, then perform various Machine Learning / Data Mining Algorithms with the scraped data sets.

#### Intended algorthms:
Principal Component Analysis, Singular Value Decomposition, Support Vector Machines  
Maybe some Clustering algorithms to classify teams/players in certain ways (WIP)
